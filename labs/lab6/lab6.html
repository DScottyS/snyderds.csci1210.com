        <h2>Calembel, Gondor</h2>

        <!-- Enter a brief paragraph here telling the reader where you are from and how long you've lived there. Tell a little about your hometown (estimated population, how old, things like that).

        <p>
            I hail from a small town that used to be located in Gondor, near the river Ciril. My town is not known for
            much, but we used to be one of the biggest suppliers of wheat and milk to Minas Tirith! Unfortunately, all
            the town is known for these days is getting destroyed by a bunch of ghosts during the War of the Ring.

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <!-- Enter a brief paragraph (3 sentences minimum). In this paragraph, tell the reader your name, your major, what year you are, when you expect to graduate. Tell the reader what interests you most about your major. -->
        <p>
            All my education, like many of those who grew up in Calembel, comes from the town's oldest man, hairy Harry.
            He taught us in a barn I learned many things during those days, such as how to count chickens and groom
            horses (still not sure when this one will come into play but im sure it will be handy some day). I graduated
            from the barn in the spring of 3014 and immediately became a farmhand for balding Bradford, the town's least
            popular farmer (he smelled strongly of petrichor and elderberries).
