        Deconstructing an element requires an understanding of HTML and CSS; the combination of structure and style that results in the display of a given element as you see it on a web page. It is sort of a mental exercise where you have to consider both what HTML underlies the element (is it a paragraph, a div, a list, or something else?) as well as the CSS that was utilized to make that element look the way it does. CSS facilitates this by using property names that are self-descriptive, i.e., if the background is green, then the bacground-color property was likely used to make it that way.
