    <h1>History of Information Technology</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <!-- First Paragraph-->
        Humans have used devices to help them perform operations, especially mathmatical operations, for centuries. From hash marks on a stick for counting, to the abacus, to more complicated mechanical calculators, tools have been developed to ease the burden of doing stuff in our heads.
    </p>
    <p> <!-- Second Paragraph-->
        As technology and the use of manipulation of electricity evolved, many people started thinking of using electricity to perform past and more complicated future operations. During World War II, perhaps most famously, Alan Touring and his colleagues developed a device that helped the Allies crack (some of) the most complex ciphers (used by Nazi Germany) known at the time.
    </p>
    <p> <!-- Second Paragraph-->
        After the war, the notion of digital computing continued to evolve, with many institutions and individuals contributing to its progress. Today, almost 100 years later, Information Technology is highly evolved and a part of our everyday lives. And progress continues, with modern computers helping to pave the way to the future!
