        <h1>More HTML</h1>
        <p>
            in this assignment, we'll look at more HTML, including <b>headings, divs, paragraphs,</b> and <b>lists</b>
        </p>
        <div>
            <p>
                We can, and often do, nest <b>div</b> elements within one another. The reasons for doing this will become apparent as wee go on, but <b>div</b>s are &quot;general purpose&quot; kinds of elements that can be customized for different uses (more on that when we get into <i>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</i>).
            </p>
        <div>
            <p>
                Another common set of HTML elemets are lists: Ordered, Unordered, and Definition Lists.
            </p>

    <h1>Lists</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Ordered Lists</h2>
        <p>
            Ordered lists are also known as &quot;Numbered Lists.&quot; Sometimes, the order in which items appear in a list is important, like a list of instructions.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Underwear</li>
            <li>Pants</li>
            <li>Shoes</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            It's important to remember that with numbered lists, we don't have to add the numbers. The browser will do that when the list is rendered.
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h2>Unordered Lists</h2>
        <p>
            Another type of lists, for when the ordere of the list items isn't important, is called &quot;Unordered Lists.&quot; We sometimes refer to these as <i>bulleted lists</i>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Eat</li>
            <li>Sleep</li>
            <li>Code</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h2>Definition Lists</h2>
        <p>
            A final type of lists included in HTML is &quot;Definition Lists&quot; These can be useful for glossaries, phone lists, etc.
        </p>
