    <h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>

    <p>
        HTML is an acronym for Hypertext Markup Language. It is also known as &quot;The Language of the Web.&quot; HTML is the brainchild of Sir Time Berners-Lee, who also developed the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifies. Together the three technologies make the Web possible.
    </p>


    <p>
        HTML is a plain-text Language. This means that web pages are human readable. The &quot;Markup&quot; part of HTML simply means that we use characters that have a special meaning for web browsers to modify how the browser presents the content. These special characters are called &quot;tags.&quot; Tags, coupled with their content, are referred to as &quot;elements.&quot;
    </p>

    <p>
        The paragraph element is one of the basic build blocks of HTML. It is a &quot;block level&quot; element, which means that it breaks the flow of content of the page as it is rendered and adds whitespace before and after.
    </p>


    <h2>Basic HTML</h2>
    <p>
        There are a number HTML tags elements that we will explore this semester, including anchor tags and elements that we will explore this semester, including anchor tags (for hyperlinks), img (for images), strong, em, b, i, ul (lists), ol (numbered lists), hr (horizontal rule), br (line break), div, spans, and many, many more.
    </p>

    <h2>Remember</h2>
    <p> 
        This is a very basic web page. Gradually, as the semester progresses, we will learn how to make more complex pages, as well as how modify their appearance with CSS.
